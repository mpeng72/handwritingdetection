# Alphanumeric Handwriting Detection using Tensorflow

Handwritten text recognition model built using tensorflow and the EMNIST dataset which can be found [here](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset). The EMNIST dataset contains 62 classes containing the digits 0-9 and A-Z characters in both upper and lowercase. A model to detect handwriting was generated from the 'byclass' type of this dataset, which contains 814,255 images, using a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN.

This project also contains models generated from the MNIST dataset and a A-Z uppercase letter dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)
